Folders on google drive, You need the folder ID for both.
1. Remote shared folder or CopyFrom - This is the folder that you add to your google drive
2. Remote owned folder or CopyTo - This is the folder that you own on google drive.

The remote owned folder is treated as a temporary folder to allow for workflows involving "rclone crypt" 
and dowloading to your hdd instead of keeping it on google drive.


Folders accessible on your local filesystem (Gsuite G:, rclone mount X: or just a 12Tb hdd)
1. GameDir - This is where new games are scanned.


The process for aquiring a new title from CopyFrom is

Stage 1. This happens on google drive (automated)

1. Match a titleid from filename in CopyFrom
2. Check if we own the game in database
3. If we own it skip copying,
   Otherwise create copy of file in CopyTo.

Stage 2. Intermediary (I dont have a script for this personally right now)

For me it is running rclone copy from "CopyTo" to a rclone crypt destination.
For you it can be that or putting the games to a HDD or just google drive.

Stage 3. Adding owned games (automated)

1. Run through files in the GameDir off titleid.
2  If titleid exists update directory if different,
   If not then titleid is marked owned in database.
   If we have a "eshop" info for the titleid its linked otherwise an orphan is created.
   

All games available to us are either in CopyFrom, CopyTo or GameDir.
